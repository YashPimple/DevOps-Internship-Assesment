**Ans**: 

For the above question I was unable to make use of the provided wizdesk repository due to *GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID* issue but irrespective of that I have provided a **[Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/YashPimple/DevOps-Internship-Assesment/blob/main/04-CI-CD/Jenkinsfile)** from my prior project named [Deployment-of-webgame-through-ArgoCD-and-GitOps](https://github.com/YashPimple/Deployment-of-webgame-through-ArgoCD-and-GitOps) which showcase my solution towards the above question to automate the build, test, create a docker image out of it and update the docker image with new tag further helping it to deploy it on K8.
